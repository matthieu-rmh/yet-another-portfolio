# Yes, yet another portfolio

This would be my definitive portfolio I promise :')
Scaffolded in Vue to alleviate all the tedious processes
but I plan to build everything here by "hand" especially sick
animations which I wanna learn and replicate here xD

(Below is just the default Node / Vue setup)

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
